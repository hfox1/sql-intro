```
## 2. Infer the Table Name and Columns
```
students 
  name 
tags 
  tag
students_tags
  student_id, tag_id

```
## 4. Write the SQL.

```sql

CREATE TABLE students (
  id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
  name text
);

-- Create the second table.
CREATE TABLE tags (
  id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
  name text
);

-- Create the join table.
CREATE TABLE students_tags (
  student_id int,
  tag_id int,
  constraint fk_post foreign key(student_id) references students(id) on delete cascade,
  constraint fk_tag foreign key(tag_id) references tags(id) on delete cascade,
  PRIMARY KEY (student_id, tag_id)
);

```

## 5. Create the tables.

```bash
psql -h 127.0.0.1 database_name < posts_tags.sql
```
